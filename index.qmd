# Master Security

We base our Initiative: Master Security on Planning a [Minumum Viable Nothing (MVN)](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/minimum-viable-nothing).

1. Identify and understand the **Business Needs**.

a) Determine the **long-term goal** of the product (i.e., good or service) and write it down.

b) Answer the question "**Why are we doing this project?**"

c) Identify the **success criteria** that will indicate whether or not the product (i.e., good or service) is successful.
